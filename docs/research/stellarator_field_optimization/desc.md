DESC solves for and optimizes 3D MHD equilibria using pseudo-spectral
numerical methods and automatic differentiation.

The theoretical approach and implementation details used by DESC are
presented in the following papers and documented at
[Theory](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory_general.html).

## Quick Start

The easiest way to install DESC is from PyPI: `pip install desc-opt`

For more detailed instructions on installing DESC and its dependencies,
see
[Installation](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

The best place to start learning about DESC is our tutorials:

-   [Basic fixed boundary
    equilibrium](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/basic_equilibrium.html):
    running from a VMEC input, creating an equilibrium from scratch
-   [Advanced
    equilibrium](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/advanced_equilibrium_continuation.html):
    continuation and perturbation methods.
-   [Free boundary
    equilibrium](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/free_boundary_equilibrium.html):
    vacuum and or finite beta with external field.
-   [Using DESC
    outputs](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/use_outputs.html):
    analysis, plotting, saving to VMEC format.
-   [Basic
    optimization](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/basic_optimization.html):
    specifying objectives, fixing degrees of freedom.
-   [Advanced
    optimization](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/advanced_optimization.html):
    advanced constraints, precise quasi-symmetry, constrained
    optimization.
-   [Near axis
    constraints](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/nae_constraint.html):
    loading solutions from QSC/QIC and fixing near axis expansion.
-   [Coil
    optimization](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/coil_stage_two_optimization.html):
    \"second stage\" optimization of magnetic coils.

For details on the various objectives, constraints, optimizable objects
and more, see the full [api
documentation](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

If all you need is an equilibrium solution, the simplest method is
through the command line by giving an input file specifying the
equilibrium and solver options, this way can also can also accept VMEC
input files.

The code is run using the syntax `desc <path/to/inputfile>` and the full
list of command line options are given in [Command Line
Interface](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html).
(Note that you may have to prepend the command with `python -m`)

Refer to [Inputs](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input.html)
for documentation on how to format the input file.

The equilibrium solution is output in a HDF5 binary file, whose format
is detailed in
[Outputs](https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html).
