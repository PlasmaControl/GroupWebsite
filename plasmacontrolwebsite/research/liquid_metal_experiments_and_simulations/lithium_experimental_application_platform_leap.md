# Lithium Experimental Application Platform (LEAP)

[The Lithium Experimental Application Platform (LEAP)](https://sites.google.com/pppl.gov/leap/home) concept is a flowing liquid Lithium testing facility for reactor LMPFC designs that meet national laboratory safety standards for Lithium experiments. Its central component will be a large (2m x 3m x 2m) pre-fabricated glovebox. This system aims to be rated to store 50lb of lithium in maximum inventory. It will be equipped with heat sources and magnetic fields to qualify components for evaluation in the NSTX-U liquid metal core-edge facility (LMCE), including concepts proposed by the LMCE user community, such as a free-flow LM system.
